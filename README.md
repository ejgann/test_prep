## Challenges
This was my first Rails project, so the challenges were numerous as I became familiar with a new language. The biggest challenge for me was understanding how to express logic in the Rails syntax. Something I thought would be relatively easy to implement took twice as long to implement.

## Future Implementations
In the future, I would like to try refactoring this project to incorporate React and Redux to challenge myself since I have learned additional languages since the time I completed this project.
